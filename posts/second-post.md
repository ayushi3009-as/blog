Digital Minimalism: Designing a Life with Less Tech Clutter
My desktop used to look like my mind: 42 tabs open, icons scattered, five to-do apps half-used. Tech was supposed to simplify my life, but it multiplied my options.

Then I discovered digital minimalism—not minimal tech, but intentional tech. I started deleting apps I hadn’t used in 30 days. I merged tools. I picked one calendar, one note app, one password manager. My inbox became a quiet place.

Now, my digital environment is calm. My phone’s home screen has just one page. My work apps stay hidden on weekends. Instead of being constantly "on," I’ve found pockets of stillness in a high-speed world.

Less tech noise, more tech harmony.
