The Mindful Scroll: Reclaiming Attention in a Hyperconnected World
Every morning, my phone greets me before sunlight does. Notifications flutter like digital birds: emails, updates, headlines from continents away. It's convenient—until it's too much.

Tech has given us superpowers: instant knowledge, remote work, endless connection. But it also fragments our attention. We scroll without aim. We multitask to the point of mental clutter. Somewhere between our third tab and tenth notification, we lose presence.

The shift isn't to abandon tech. It's to use it mindfully. I turned off push notifications. I deleted apps that drained more than they gave. I now schedule "screen sabbath" days, where I read paper books and listen—really listen—to podcasts, not just background noise.

The goal isn't to unplug entirely. It's to plug in with purpose.
